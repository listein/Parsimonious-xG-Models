# Parsimonious xG Models

This repository contains all the files created and used for my Bachelor Thesis. 

The data used is available at https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data. The open dataset offered by StatsBomb contains a large amount of football data from various competitions. It also contains data for both genders, making it possible to analyse the men's game as well as the women's game.
